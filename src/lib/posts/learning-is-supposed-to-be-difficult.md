Learning is supposed to be difficult.

There are a million products and courses that sell "make learning x easy". You should be as suspicous of these courses as a "lose weight without getting off the couch or eating less" course. It should set off the same alarm bells. It signals the seller is interested in your money, not your results.

When you are learning, you should be making a full effort. You should be pushing right at the edge of what you are capable of, which must be difficult. If it's easy, you are doing it wrong. It should be engaging and challenging, but not easy. You should aim for what Csikszentmihalyi calls "flow", acting just within your capabilities on a difficult problem.

This seems to be an accepted fact for most of us in the fitness and health industry. We know and accept that losing weight or gaining muscle must be difficult. "Training till failure" is the way to get stronger. We hire personal trainers to make sessions more difficult, not easier,

Courses advertised for mental skills appear to have this backwards. They try to sell you on how easy it will be to achieve the desired result. It should be an obvious contradiction, but these sorts of products seem to convince many of us (myself included) to purchase them.

Stop avoiding the uncertainty and difficulty of learning. If its hard, you're going in the right direction. Lean into the challenge and you will come out stronger and smarter than anyone that tries to shortcut their way to the finish line.
