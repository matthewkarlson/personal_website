Software engineers SUCK at marketing, which is why most junior engineers have their CV's auto-rejected.

Software engineers like to talk about features. We love explaining our elegant solutions and the awesome features we've built. It's intuitive and feels natural. This happens when we're writing CV's or job applications. We love to talk about our skills and our "features".

One of the first things you learn in marketing is that nobody buys features. They buy outcomes. In much the same way, nobody hires you because of your "features". They hire you because they think you'll get them their desired outcome.

Don't advertise your "advanced python knowledge". Nobody cares. Talk about the outcomes you delivered using your skills, talk about the hours of time you saved the ops team by automating one of their most tedious processes.

If you don't have any job experience and are finding it hard to get a job, its because the ONLY thing you can show employers is "features" or qualifications. Nobody hires you because of your qualifications. Instead of sending 100 applications and getting no feedback, spend a week using your skills to deliver an outcome. Deliver an outcome for yourself, for a friend, a family member. Literally just do anything other than sending your CV straight into the junk folder of a recruiter's inbox.

This is because employers don't TRUST you. They aren't going to waste their time talking to everyone who writes "advanced python" on their CV. Talk is cheap. Give them proof you can deliver an outcome.

Of course, you have to tick some boxes, so obviously things like education and certain parts of cv will just be listing your skills. Apart from those few places, you should include outcomes EVERYWHERE YOU POSSIBLY CAN. You should feel uncomfortable if you have written something down where you could have included an outcome and didn't.

Psychology is such an overlooked and misunderstood field. If you master the few basic concepts in psychology and marketing that unlock 80% of the value, you can start outcompeting people with way more technical skill or experience than you.

Communicating in terms of outcomes will help you in other areas too. Pitching ideas to stakeholders. Negotiating with people inside and outside of work.

Psychology is a part of "The Full Stack". Don't sleep on it. Start communicating outcomes instead of features and watch your response rate soar.
